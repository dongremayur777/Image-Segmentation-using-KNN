Digital Image Processing

## Image Segmentation
Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called Image segments which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler. Segmentation in easy words is assigning labels to pixels. All picture elements or pixels belonging to the same category have a common label assigned to them. For example: Letâ€™s take a problem where the picture has to be provided as input for object detection. Rather than processing the whole image, the detector can be inputted with a region selected by a segmentation algorithm. This will prevent the detector from processing the whole image thereby reducing inference time.

# Approaches in Image Segmentation
Similarity approach: This approach is based on detecting similarity between image pixels to form a segment, based on a threshold. ML algorithms like clustering are based on this type of approach to segment an image.

Discontinuity approach: This approach relies on the discontinuity of pixel intensity values of the image. Line, Point, and Edge Detection techniques use this type of approach for obtaining intermediate segmentation results which can be later processed to obtain the final segmented image.

## KNN

K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm 
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.
It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.
KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.
